## Ok, what the fox? *Another ECS?!*
# :neofox_facepalm: We know... oh, _we know._    

Yet, in the tiniest of nutshells: 
> _... this one hits different._

**fenn**ecs is an archetype-based [C# Entity-Component System](https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq) library. It targets [.NET 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0) and is distributed as a prebuilt [nuget package](http://nuget.org/packages/fennecs) or in source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/outfox/fennecs). The broader term [ECS](https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-ecs) describes a family of architectures and design patterns most commonly used in **Game Development** and **Simulation Software**, applying various principles of **Data-Oriented Design** to leverage the capabilities of modern CPUs.

**fenn**ecs strictly adheres to its design principles of reducing boilerplate and cognitive load first and foremost. Second, we explore innovative approaches to structuring and querying component data without sacrificing flexibility. 

Furthermore, **fenn**ecs allows developers to mix and match the advantages of procedural, functional, and SIMD programming, as well as to follow both compositional and inheritance-based approaches to domain modeling. 

Doing all this with literally *zero dependency baggage* sets **fenn**ecs apart from many bulkier, more rigid, or more opinionated libraries.

### Come on in, check out ~~[the fox](/docs/index.md)~~ [the docs!](/docs/index.md)

Beyond its goals for simplicity and flexibility, you may discover that **fenn**ecs still punches way above its weight in terms of performance. Our cheeky little library lives up to its name by all at once being **small, clever, quick,** *and full of* **delightfully terrible puns!**
