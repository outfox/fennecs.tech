## Ok, what the fox? *Another ECS?!*
# :neofox_facepalm: We know... oh, _we know._    

In a tiny nutshell, let's be real - this one just hits different. Straight up:

###  **fenn**ecs is an archetype-based [üîóEntity-Component System](https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq). 

ECS is an architecture and Design Pattern most commonly used in **Game Development** and **Simulation Software**, applying various principles of **Data-Oriented Design** to leverage the capabilities of modern CPUs.

**fenn**ecs strictly adheres to its design principles of reducing boilerplate and cognitive load first and foremost. Second we explore innovative approaches to structuring and querying component data without sacrificing flexibility.

Despite this primary focus, you may discover that **fenn**ecs still punches way above its weight in terms of performance. Our cheeky little library lives up to its name by all at once being **small, clever, quick,** *and <u>full of</u>* **delightfully terrible puns!**
